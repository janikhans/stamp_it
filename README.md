# CalledOut

CalledOut is a game/social reputation tracking platform built using the
[Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework and can be previewed
[here](https://quiet-waters-69875.herokuapp.com/). Currently in development so
don't expect it too look pretty.

## About

Tired of hearing people spout out the same garbage time and time again? Ever
wonder how often they actually follow through with their promises? CalledOut aims
to gather that information in the form of a fun game/social media platform.

## Git up 'n running!

Clone this repo to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/janikhans/stamp_it.git
    cd stamp_it

Please note...

    Running postgresql                  # Make sure you have PostGres installed and running locally

Once you have cloned a copy of the repo, do your typical...

    bundle install                      # Shocker, right?
    rake db:create:all
    rake db:migrate
    rake db:seed

## Where it's at right 'meow

It's still in a very basic form right now. A user can signup/signin, create 'Stamps',
bet on other stamps and complete stamps. A reputation bank/wallet system is next
up on the list of immediate plans.

## Future Goals

This is obviously a basic MVP right now. There are quite a few plans in the works
but this is the basic timeline...

* Basic functionality of all betting/callout creation
* Potentially following users
* Styling
* Admin area
* ALPHA!
* ...

# Go 'git r' dun!
